 ## June and December Weather Comparison
The temperature between June and December is very similar.  December is on average 4 degrees cooler than June, but the range in December is much greater. Temperature can fluctuate close to 30 degrees in one day in December, and only 20 in June. December typically has more rainfall, and this would not be good for surfers and the Surf and Shake. June would be a better month for business. 

## Further Analysis
-	If we could gather some data on what time of the day it is most likely to be raining in Oahu, this could help us understand if the rain is affecting surfers and businesses. Hawaiiâ€™s climate is very tropical and rain is expected. The average duration of rainfall would also be wise to analyze.
-	Gathering more data about the time of day and duration of the rainfall would be extremely important. Displaying this information in a line chart would be very useful to clearly tell the trends throughout the year.
-	Surf and Shake may also benefit from analyzing wind speed, and tide patterns in different parts of the island to determine which part would be best for the most consistent waves year around.
